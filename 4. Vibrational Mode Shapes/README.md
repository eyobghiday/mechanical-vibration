Consider the equation of motion of a simple pendulum:
Let’s say the equilibrium configurations are given by
(a) Show that the two distinct equilibrium configurations for the pendulum are
(b) Derive the linearized equations of motion with respect to new coordinates   and . These two equations govern the pendulum’s deviation from these two
equilibriums when the deviations are small.
(c) By analyzing the solutions of the equations, show that is stable equilibrium and   is
unstable equilibrium.
Q2. Consider the general solution of given by . Consider the initial conditions   .   are given by
Plot the following for an appropriately long time period, and comment on the dynamics revealed in each plot.

Note that this is the case when there is no damping term in
the equation.
