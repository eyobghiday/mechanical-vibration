# mechanical-vibration
This repo is a project for the analysis, study and design of mechanical vibrations.  The topics include one dimensional motion of elastic continuum, traveling waves, standing waves, energy flux, and the use of Fourier integrals. Problem statement in dynamic elasticity, uniqueness of solution, basic solution of elastodynamics, integral representations, steady state time harmonic response. Elastic waves in unbounded medium, plane harmonic waves in elastic half-spaces, reflection and transmission at interfaces, Rayleigh waves, Stoneley waves, slowness diagrams, dispersive waves in waveguides and phononic composites, thermal effects and effects of viscoelasticity, anisotropy, and nonlinearity on wave propagation.
